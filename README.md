To compile (this does some other operations too...):

    $ ./makeBook.sh

Note:
To rip tabs/chords off of ultimate guitar execute *./uG-rip.sh* and enter the
song and artist names. Don't surround them with quotation marks, just hyphens
for spaces:

    $ ./uG-rip.sh <url> [enter]
    ..... <song name>
    ..... <artist name>

*process.py* is a sort of html processor that removes characters that LaTeX
doesn't like
